#what ideas do you have for your final project?

For my final project, I want to make a Mario inspired game. 
Some of my ideas I have to create the project:
- change the shapes and colors used to create a new theme (space, underwater, etc.)
- add a few obstacles in the game
- add coins of different values in the game, which add to the total score
- add a time limit to collect points

#If you plan to collaborate with classmates, what are their names?

I plan to do my final project on my own.

#Do you have any questions of your own?

Nope
